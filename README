getfeed is a RSS/Atom feed fetcher.

This script fetches configured feeds, caches them and send new messages to
external program.  Though, caching does not work yet.

This software is initially intended to pipe feeds to a mail delivery agent to
read them in your favourite mail client.

There is another similar script, r2e, [1]. It is written in python too and uses
the same feedparser [2], but it lacks some features I'd like to see.

If you want any missing info on the project, just ask me. You may fill an issue
form at bug tracker if you think that this info should be in README. Or you may
email me directly. Please see BUGS section on how to do that.

FILES

getfeed.py - main script executable
getfeed-9999.ebuild - gentoo ebuild for git HEAD (unfinished)

BUGS

* There is no corrent MIME types and character encodings interpretation yet. To
be continued.

* No configuration file format persistence is guaranteed at the moment.

Please, report any bugs and desired features including spelling and grammar
errors in both messages and README etc.
