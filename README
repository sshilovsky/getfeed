getfeed is a RSS/Atom feed fetcher.

This script fetches configured feeds, caches them and send new messages to
external program.  Though, caching does not work yet.

This software is initially intended to pipe feeds to a mail delivery agent to
read them in your favourite mail client.

There is another similar script, r2e, [1]. It is written in python too and uses
the same feedparser [2], but it lacks some features I'd like to see, including:

* getfeed acts mostly like a popular getmail[3].
* Simple and powerful (YAML) configuration file format.
* You may split all your feeds and destinations through your configuration
  files the way you want. You can also call getfeed for only those
  configuration files you want.
* Unix-wayity: getfeed does only what it should do: it gets a feed, split it
  into separate messages and pipe them to external program. SMTP absence IS a
  feature. Use msmtp[4], sendmail[5] or other analogues for it. Mbox/maildir support
  absence is a feature too. Use maildrop[6], procmail[7] or other analogues for that.
* XDG-Basedir support.

If you want any missing info on the project, just ask me. You may fill an issue
form at bug tracker if you think that this info should be in README. Or you may
email me directly. Please see BUGS section on how to do that.

USAGE

See sample-config.yaml for the sample configuration. Request documentation if
you want it.

Default configuration file location is '~/.config/getfeed/config.yaml'. You may
tell getfeed to use another or other configuration files with '-r' command line
parameters. Use "./" prefix to proceed a file from the current directory. If
you don't the file will be looked at ~/.config/getfeed/ by default.

BUGS

* There is no corrent MIME types and character encodings interpretation yet. To
be continued.

* No configuration file format persistence is guaranteed at the moment.

Please, report any bugs and desired features including spelling and grammar
errors in both messages and README etc.
